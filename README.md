# Chproxy

Chproxy is a Ruby script that automatically finds a proxy in the country of your choice and configures your Ubuntu-based OS proxy settings to point to it. It's still under active development and should become more user-friendly and support a wider range of OSes in time.

To use, make sure you have the [nokogiri](http://www.nokogiri.org/tutorials/installing_nokogiri.html), [rest-client](https://github.com/rest-client/rest-client) and [highline](https://github.com/JEG2/highline) gems installed, download the script, change to your download directory and run with `ruby chproxy.rb`
